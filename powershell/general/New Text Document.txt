More about getting modules from the internet
The PowerShellGet module allows installing modules from http://PowerShellGallery
.com. Using PowerShellGet is easy and can even be fun:
? Run Register-PSRepository to add the URL of a repository. http://
PowerShellGallery.com is usually set up by default, but it’s even possible to
set up your own “gallery” internally for private use, and you’d use RegisterPSRepository to point to it.
? Use Find-Module to find modules in repositories. You can use wildcards (*)
in names, specify tags, and have many other choices for narrowing the
search results.
? Use Install-Module to download and install a module after you’ve found it.
? Use Update-Module to make sure your local copy of a module is the latest
version, and if it isn’t, download and install the latest.
PowerShellGet includes several other commands (http://PowerShellGallery.com
links to the documentation), but these are the ones you’ll start out using. For example, try installing the Azure PowerShell module, or Jeff Hicks’s PSScriptTools module
from the PowerShell Gallery.
